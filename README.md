# What does this do
This app aims to do one thing : compute stats similar to the ones you'll find on the slippi desktop app, but for multiple files at once.
The goal here is to provide players with valuable insight regarding their gameplay, to help them work on their weaker sides.

A few extra functionalities have been added to help assessing progress between sessions, be it one vs one stats comparisons, or via a graph display when considering bigger datasets
